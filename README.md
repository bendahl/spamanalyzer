spamanalyzer
============

A small utility to help identify possible spammers by checking their username, e-mail, IP, etc... In addition to the core functionality of the program, the intention behind the project is to provide a platform for experimentation regarding different aspects of the Java SE platform. 

The main program implements a plugin registry. Plugins can easily be created by implementing the "Plugin" interface which is located in the spamanalyzer-datatypes artefact.

To get a first impression how everything works, run the build.sh script, start the main program and dive in! More information and documentation will be added soon!

Feel free to fork the project and dive in. Contributions are very welcome!
